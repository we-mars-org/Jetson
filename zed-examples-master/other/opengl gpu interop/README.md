# Stereolabs ZED - CUDA-OpenGL interoperability

This sample allows you to display a GPU sl::Mat directly with OpenGL, by using the CUDA - OpenGL interoperability. 

## Getting started

- First, download the latest version of the ZED SDK on [stereolabs.com](https://www.stereolabs.com).
- For more information, read the ZED [API documentation](https://www.stereolabs.com/developers/documentation/API/).

### Prerequisites

- Windows 7 64bits or later, Ubuntu 16.04
- [ZED SDK](https://www.stereolabs.com/developers/) and its dependencies ([CUDA](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads))

## Build the program

Download the sample and follow these instructions:

#### Build for Windows

- Create a "build" folder in the source folder
- Open cmake-gui and select the source and build folders
- Generate the Visual Studio `Win64` solution
- Open the resulting solution and change configuration to `Release`
- Build solution

#### Build for Linux

Open a terminal in the sample directory and execute the following command:

    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ..
    make

## Run the program

Open a terminal in build directory and execute the following command:

     ./ZED\ openGL\ gpu\ interop(.exe)
